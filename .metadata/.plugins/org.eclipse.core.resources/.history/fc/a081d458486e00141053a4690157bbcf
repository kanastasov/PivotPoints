//Support Level 1 = (2 * Pivot Point) - Previous High
//
//Resistance Level 2 = (Pivot Point - Support Level 1) + Resistance Level 1
//
//Support Level 2 = Pivot Point - (Resistance Level 1 - Support Level 1)

//Resistance Level 3 = (Pivot Point - Support Level 2) + Resistance Level 2

//Support Level 3 = Pivot Point - (Resistance Level 2 - Support Level 2)
